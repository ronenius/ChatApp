The project is a chat application (like WhatsApp) for android that was built with Android Studio.
The project contains an Android application that starts with sign in and register screens that go to the contacts list. In the contacts list, you can search for any contact by their name.
Also, you have buttons there that go to settings screen and add new contact screen.
When tapping on a contact, the chat screen with this contact appears. In the chat, you can see all of the previous messages with this contact and you can add a new text message from your side with the text input below and the send button.
Unfortunately, we couldn't finish the project in time because in the middle of the work, Ronen had to go abroad.
He brought his laptop with him to be able to work there. But, unfortunately the outlet there was different from here and when the battery of the laptop ran out, he didn't find a way to charge it.
Furthermore, Yoad had a problem in his computer that prevented him from running the server project from assignment 2 (although Ronen checked it on different computers and it worked).
Because of that, we couldn't work on server API related parts in this project.
Also, Yoad is a part of Israel's national math team and right after Ronen came back, Yoad had to go to the math team's camp for a few days and couldn't work at all there.
Because of mentioned reasons, we couldn't finish the project, and we really hope that you can take it into account when checking and grading the project.
Some of the functionalities in the project don't work because they require communication with the server, which doesn't work.
